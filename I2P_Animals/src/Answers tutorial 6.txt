1.
vroom
truck 1
car 2
1b. The call system.out.pritnln(mycar) will print vroom vroom, since the tostring
returns twice
mycar.m1(); will print truck 1
mycar.m2(); will print car 1 since the m2() method in the truck class ovverides
the m2 method in the car class

2.this will print the system print call first for the first element of the array
which is A which extends B which extends C, so A when printed will call on its
superclass B and print b
then the method calls will be printed for each element of the array
the call A.method1 will print c 1 since A does not have a method1 defined, nor does
its immediate superclass B
the call A.method2 will print a 2 since method 2 exists in the class A
the call to print B will print b since it has a tostring method
the call b.method1 will print c 1 since b does not have a method1 and it's immediate superclass C does
the call b.method2 will print b 2 since b has a method2
the call to print c will print c since c has a toString method
the call c.method1 will print c 1 since c has a method1 defined
the call c.method2 will print c 2 since c has a method 2 defined
the call to print D will print D since D extends B and D does not have a toString method but B does
the call d.method 1 will print d 1 since d has a method1 defined
the call d.method2 will print b 2 since D does not have a method2 defined but its superclass B does
